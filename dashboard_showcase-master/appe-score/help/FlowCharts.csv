The first item selected will appear at the outer left, while the last item will appear at the outer right of the chart area. At least 2 items must be selected to render the chart.

"4","The charts shows a flow chart of the seleted items. The chart is know as a Sankey diagram, which is a specific type of flow diagram in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity. Note that each labeled entry has a prefix, which is added to prevent cycles in the Sankey chart e.g. in case that label uses names that also appear in product categories. In Sankey diagrams this is not allowed.","#FlowCharts-SankeyChart1","auto"
